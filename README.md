## Functionality: How our solution tackles the issues?
This solution will tackle all of the issues in one central place. The application will allow a person to easily keep track of their calories by calculating the calories they have consumed each day based on their food input. On top of providing recommendations for foods, the app will also provide recipes for their recommendations, giving users a personal experience and an opportunity to make the dishes themselves. The app will also contain a feature where users can track their daily nutritional intake based on the foods they have eaten, providing an extra layer of personalization that helps them visualize the healthiness of the food they eat. 

## Operations: Expected User operations
#### User:
* Create account
* Add in favorite foods and recipes
* Input food eaten for the day
* List allergies/dislikes (to avoid food referrals)
* Create a calorie count goal
* Get recipe for dishes

## Solution:
We solved the solution for the people who were having hard time keeping track of their calorie and to reach their goal of losing or gaining weight. Most of the diseases these days are due to obesity and unbalanced dies. Our applicaiton solved this problem by tracking the calorie count, setting the goal so that user can reach their weight goal. By addressing all of the problems at once, this application will be effective. By figuring out how many calories a person has eaten each day based on the food they have entered, the program will make it simple for them to keep track of their intake. The app will include recipes in addition to culinary recommendations, allowing users to have a more hands-on experience and prepare the dishes themselves. Additionally, the app will have a feature that allows users to keep track of their daily nutritional intake based on the foods they consume. This feature adds a level of customization and helps users see how healthy the food they consume is.
