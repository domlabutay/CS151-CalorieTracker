# Assumptions / operating environments / intended usage
### Assumptions: People insert the food and calories they track
### OE: it will be a website on your computer or code that can run on your localhost
### Usage: this app will be to count your calories and to get suggestions on what to eat next based on if you’ve had breakfast, lunch, dinner and your calorie goal

# High-level description of your solution which may include (but is not limited to), your plan and approach.  Be as specific as possible.
### For the front end, we will be using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. For the back end, we will be using various API’s and primarily working in Java(springboot). We will also be using MongoDB for our database.
We will divide the work by features among the members. We are all full-stack developers and will be working on both frontend and backend for each of the features assigned to us and merge each together as we implement them. To start, each separate feature that we work on will be handled in a separate page and most likely combined into a single page once we get everything working. We will have soft deadlines for the features based on cycles and change the workload as needed for more intensive features. 
### Functionality: describe how your solution tackles the issues
This solution will tackle all of the issues in one central place. The application will allow a person to easily keep track of their calories by calculating the calories they have consumed each day based on their food input. On top of providing recommendations for foods, the app will also provide recipes for their recommendations, giving users a personal experience and an opportunity to make the dishes themselves. The app will also contain a feature where users can track their daily nutritional intake based on the foods they have eaten, providing an extra layer of personalization that helps them visualize the healthiness of the food they eat. 
### Operations: List operations for each intended user (in list format).  Be precise and specific.
### User:
* Create account
* Add in favorite foods and recipes
* Input food eaten for the day
* List allergies/dislikes (to avoid food referrals)
* Create a calorie count goal
* Get recipe for dishes
# Admin (?):
### Add new recipes 

# References: must include citations in content using the format [1], [2], etc.
